## Understanding Continuous Integration (CI)

## Traditional CI Method (Old Approach)

1. Multiple developers work on the same repository, each developing their features in separate branches.
2. Once development is complete, the changes are handed over to an integration team responsible for merging them into the main branch.
3. After integration, the code is passed to the Quality Assurance (QA) team for testing to ensure everything works as expected.
4. If issues are found, the process starts overâ€”developers fix the problems, and the integration and QA cycle repeats.
   5 .Main Issue: This approach is time-consuming, often taking days or even weeks to detect and fix issues before the code can be released.

## Modern CI Method (New Approach)

1. Multiple developers still work on separate feature branches within the same repository.
2. When developers complete their work, they push their changes and create a pull request (PR) on GitHub (or another version control platform).
3. Automated CI pipelines run as soon as a PR is created, following predefined steps.
4. These steps typically include:
   - Building the application with the new changes.
   - Running automated tests to check for functionality issues.
   - Linting to ensure consistent code formatting.
   - Security scanning to detect vulnerabilities.
5. This automated feedback loop allows developers to quickly identify and fix issues directly within their feature branches before merging, significantly reducing delays and improving software quality.
